## Introduction

## Installation

<details>
	<summary><b>Compile your own theme</b></summary>

You need to be able to [compile omega by yourself](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega#manual), then when compiling, simply add the `THEME_NAME` argument, like this:
```bash
 make THEME_NAME="your_personnal_theme"
```
</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Compile from git</b></summary>

Same as above, simply also add the `THEME_REPO` argument:

```bash
$ make THEME_NAME=omega_blue THEME_REPO=https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega-Theme-Example
```
as said [here](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega-Theme-Example/blob/master/README.md).

## Contributing

Add your own theme by making a PR. The **name** of your theme and the **link to your repository** should be listed in the `Themes listing` section.
It's a good idea to add a screenshot of your theme on you repository readme.

A theme template is available [here](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega-Theme-Example). Feel free to fork it.

A description of the **JSON** to produce is also available in [this](descriptions/) directory (only in French currently).
